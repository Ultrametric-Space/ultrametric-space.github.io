<center><h1>Various Stuff</h1></center>

This site is where I put various things I've worked on or are currently in progress. Site was just created January 20th, 2020, so if that's recent I am probably going to be adding content soon or I have forgotten about it.

Unless otherwise stated, usually seeing \(|\cdot|\) or \(v(x)\) will mean the standard p-adic absolute value or valuation. Anywhere there is a \(p\) subscript, it is probably dropped because in the context I'm interested in we are always dealing with the \(p-\)thing.
