I plan on putting some useful references or guides for stuff I do myself rather than just hiding away any kind of documentation I have made. In particular, it will probably be more proxmox, linux, or networking related. This will serve as an initial commit to get things rolling.

<center><h1>Various Stuff</h1></center>

This site is where I put various things I've worked on or are currently in progress. Site was just created January 20th, 2020, so if that's recent I am probably going to be adding content soon or I have forgotten about it.

<a href="p-adic-calc.html">P-adic Calculator in the browser</a>
<p>
Unless otherwise stated, usually seeing \(|\cdot|\) or \(v(x)\) will mean the standard p-adic absolute value or valuation. Anywhere there is a \(p\) subscript, it is probably dropped because in the context I'm interested in we are always dealing with the \(p-\)thing.
